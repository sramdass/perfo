<% #Important:-  This form submit request is NOT AJAXIFIED. The class of the form is changed form selector-form (ajax) to

      #a redirect in the update_marks. But we need a render in the mark scenario, because we are using nested_attributes for the
      # section - mark relationship.

      #box for a short time when you select.
