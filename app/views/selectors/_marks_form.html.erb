<% #Important:-  This form submit request is NOT AJAXIFIED. The class of the form is changed form selector-form (ajax) to

      #with the _form.html's from in this same directory. If the form has to be ajaxified, the class has to be changed accordingly. 
      
      #This is not ajaxified because, there is a problem with render in the update_marks if there is a error. Ajaxified form requires
      #a redirect in the update_marks. But we need a render in the mark scenario, because we are using nested_attributes for the
      # section - mark relationship.

      #box for a short time when you select.
